# Notes
### POSTS NEEDS DATE IN FILENAME WITH yyyy-mm-dd format
### To use gists with image, create gist. Then push image, get raw image url, update link on gist. Finally, edit the gist url (?file=) to include just the one part of the gist with the new name, just copied, not the whole thing that would repeat any standalone images
### jsincluded > home(jsincluded) > index.html(home(jsincluded)) A.K.A jsincluded is essentially default layout for the homepage
