I was born and raised in Westchester, New York. I currently attend Fordham Univesity in the Bronx. I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Cybersecurity. I love all things programming, hacking, and cybersecurity. I have been rowing for 8+ years and I enjoy studying and practicing foreign languages, especially Italian and Russian.
