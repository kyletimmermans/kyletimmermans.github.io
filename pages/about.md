I was born and raised in Westchester, New York. I am currently attending NYU Tandon School of Engineering, persuing a Master's degree in Cybersecurity and I am also an SFS CyberCorps scholarship recipient. I graduated from Fordham University in the Bronx with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity. I love all things programming, hacking, and cybersecurity. I have been rowing for 8+ years and I enjoy studying and practicing foreign languages, especially Russian.
